# Etch Sketch

A "The Odin Project" project to work on the skills and knowledge that I have learnt so far from it. 

Practise makes perfect, right?

Create an area full of square divs where when you hover over with your mouse, the divs change color. Then we have different options like:

- different colours to use
- different size of square divs to colour in
- and other stuff to come..

## Initial Commit

Added files and also some basic stuff for starters.

P.S. I did forget to add some links, ssoooo next commit it is then.

## Create Basic Canvas

I have roughly created the canvas with the divs, it isnt at all how it needs to be other than let say the "shape" of it. Everything is hard-coded at the moment.
